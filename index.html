            <h3><span class="icon">💥</span> The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Prolink’s insurance claim submission process was entirely manual, requiring repeated email follow-ups, inconsistent client responses, and missing information for insurers. Each claim type — <strong>Private Homeowners, Landlords, and Commercial Policyholders</strong> — required a unique 16-question form with tailored data fields such as policy number, claim details, date of loss, and supporting documents.</p>
            <p>The complexity deepened when clients needed to be filtered by <strong>Customer Type</strong>, triggering different questions depending on their role (Policyholder, Broker, or Business). Manually sending reminders, assigning claim handlers, and ensuring forms were completed on time created significant administrative pressure and delays in submitting claims to insurers.</p>
            <p>Prolink needed an end-to-end automated workflow that could intelligently detect the customer type, assign the correct journey, send out the right qualifying form, and follow up automatically via SMS and email — all while notifying the internal team of progress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h3><span class="icon">⚙️</span> The Solution</h3>
            <p>Using <strong>GoHighLevel CRM</strong>, I designed a smart, fully automated claims workflow that activates as soon as a form is submitted on the website.</p>
            <p>The system identifies the <strong>Customer Type</strong>, applies dynamic <strong>tags</strong>, and automatically assigns the contact to the appropriate internal user whose digital signature is embedded in outgoing emails. Customers are then guided through a qualifying SMS sequence such as:</p>
            <blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #4a5568;">“Hi {{contact.first_name}}, here {{location.name}}. To help us assist you best, could you please tell us if you are a homeowner living in a home? Please answer YES or NO.”</blockquote>
            <p>Based on their reply, the workflow triggers one of three detailed claim forms — Private Homeowner, Landlord, or Commercial Policyholder — each with its own set of 16 qualifying questions. Automated timers track the customer’s response, send reminders after two days, and notify the internal team if action is needed.</p>
            <p>If a customer replies <strong>“HELP”</strong>, an instant 3-hour alert notifies the team to provide live assistance. The workflow continues monitoring activity until the form is completed, automatically sending thank-you messages and updating the CRM. Completed form data is used to generate a <strong>digital mandate document</strong>, ready for e-signature and submission to the insurer with all required details.</p>
            <p>This automation eliminated manual chasing and ensured every claim followed a clear, tracked digital journey — from intake to insurer submission.</p>
